You know what you are doing so you gathered metrics statistics from your dependency. Especially it’s response times. Let’s assume that p99 of its response times form service B are 200ms. Also, this service is fairly close to you for example in the same data center. You adjusted your timeouts accordingly, for example, you’ve set connection timeout to 50ms and socket timeout to 250ms.</description></item></channel></rss>
