When I was young I
disassembled a lot of toys and one old boombox. Unfortunately, I was not able to assemble all
of them again. I high school I fell for physics and astronomy I could finally deepen the secrets of
the universe and just before going to university I discovered how much fun programming so I decided to
study Computer Science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then a lot of has changed I have learned a lot, I started working, I met a lot of amazing people
that helped me extend my knowledge. I got a dog (he is really cute btw ðŸ˜‰). Some time ago something has changed I don't
know what yet but I recall my love for exploring and deeply understanding things, so I started to read JDK code, dig into
JVM internals, try to understand how Linux kernel work and how it affects the performance of applications. Now I want to
share this knowledge and my discoveries with others so I started this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am deeply focused on JVM internals and performance engineering right now but do a lot more in my free time. I really
like photography, especially animal and landscape photography and my dream is to one day direct my own short movie.&lt;/p>
